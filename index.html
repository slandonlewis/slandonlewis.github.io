                    <p>I am a junior software developer who got his certification from Nashville Software School at the
                        age of 20. The world of technology has always been a big part of my life.
                        At age 9, I discovered a programming platform for children known as <a
                            href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="blank
                            ">Scratch</a>. Little did I know my life would be forever changed
                        and my love for the code would ignite here! For several years, I would be the oddball in my
                        friend group who spent all of his time building projects.<br></br>

                        During my last few years of high school, I was introduced to the world of JavaScript.
                        I went through many YouTube playlists, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
                            target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
                        and
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">CodeCademy
                        </a> lessons, and
                        even <a href="https://scrimba.com" target="_blank">Scrimba</a> courses to get as
                        much
                        practice as I possibly could with the language.
                        The more I learned, the hungrier and more excited I became for greater knowledge and
                        progress!<br></br>

                        Many years later, this craving for knowledge would lead me to <a
                            href="https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/">Nashville Software School</a>, where I
                        attended the Full Time Web
                        Developer Bootcamp. This 6 month program taught everything from basic data structures,
                        iteration, functions, and debugging to concepts such as using and building Web APIs, working
                        with different programming languages as well as their frameworks and libraries, Object Oriented
                        Programming, and SO much more! But most importantly, NSS taught us the importance of teamwork
                        through planning and building a number of
                        group-based projects. All of the solo studying I tackled prior to that course
                        could never amount to the experience I gained from the hands-on, team building
                        exercises and supportive environment.<br></br>

                        I owe everything to my former instructors and classmates from NSS, and the tech community as a
                        whole, for
                        getting me as far as I have gotten. That's why I plan to give it all back by using what I've
                        learned to contribute to the growth of companies and businesses in need of developers like
                        me!<br></br>
